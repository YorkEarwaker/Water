## Hardware
what other HW to list?

### Decontamination
Process toward purification. Removal of things/substances poisonous hazardous to humans and other animals. For example removal of dissolved molecules and/or dissolved elements. For example removal of bacteria or removal of parasites. 

### Filtration
Process toward decontamination and purification. For example removal of things/substances harmful hazardous or unpleasant to humans and other animals. For example removal of non living biological matter plant or animal. 

### Purification
Toward pure H20 with no other molecules or elements. For example removal of minerals like calcium carbonate in 'hard' water? 

### Sensors
applications within the environment, water treatment, water tanks, cooling towers, sump pumps, swimming pools, ...

Sensor types
* Water level sensor
* Water quality sensor, important! high priority. 
* Water leak detector sensor
* ...

### Solar
